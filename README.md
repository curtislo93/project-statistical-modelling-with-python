# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
My goal is to use the CityBikes, Foursquare and Yelp APIs to return information on the closest bubble tea shops for each bike station.
Let us enjoy a nice cold drink after a bike ride!

## Process
#### CityBikes API
#### Foursquare/Yelp APIs

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges
